<h3>Shire</h3>
There was a young lady from the Shire<br>
Whose cloth mask did hide her fire<br>
She smiled to allow his sin in<br>
But he saw only the linen<br>
Alone he found camgirls to desire<br>

<h3>Strumpet</h3>
There was a short blond strumpet<br>
Musical mouth and hands, blowing trumpet<br>
Young labia, so pink<br>
Therein I can sink<br>
I love to taste her crumpet<br>

<h3>Trumpet Solo</h3>
<p>
Plasticized corpses of donors on show<br>
So anatomy of humans, more should know<br>
Woman with vagina showing clear<br>
Vulva removed, so trumpet shape can appear<br>
Trumpet announcing her female status<br>
Part of the fleshy, beautiful apparatus</p>
<p>
One woman trumpeting her perspective<br>
For all humans equal rights, objective<br>
To some it seemed like treason<br>
But she defended her moral reason<br>
Like a trumpet sound, clear and brave<br>
Her voice, to many hope gave </p>
