<p>Trumpet Solo

Plasticized corpses of donors on show
So anatomy of humans, more should know

Woman with vagina showing clear
Vulva removed, so trumpet shape can appear

Trumpet announcing her female status
Part of the fleshy, beautiful apparatus

One woman trumpeting her perspective
For all humans equal rights, objective

To some it seemed like treason
But she defended her moral reason

Like a trumpet sound, clear and brave
Her voice, to many hope gave
