<h3>Shire</h3>
There was a young lady from the Shire<br>
Whose cloth mask did hide her fire<br>
She smiled to allow his sin in<br>
But he saw only the linen<br>
Alone he found camgirls to desire<br>

<h3>Good Life</h3>
Good life, your life, glad breathing, glad thought, Happy Laugh<br>
Boy annoy, girl twirl, grow your name, grow slow, See Glee<br>
Man can, woman plan, bless efforts all, bless stress, Bright Delight<br>
<p style="margin-left:40px">If not Youth, Truth<

<h3Gun Girls</h3>
Sophia to long rifle does aspire<br>
Celeste presses the rifle stock to her breast<br>
Faye with an AK does spray<br>
Gun girls make my mind slowly whirl<br>
<br>
Paige loves her shotgun, large gauge<br>
Eileen deftly inserts her magazine<br>
Brie mounts her target on a tree<br>
Gun girls lead, and hearts, can hurl<br>

<h3>Trumpet Solo</h3>
<p>
Plasticized corpses of donors on show<br>
So anatomy of humans, more should know<br>
Woman with vagina showing clear<br>
Vulva removed, so trumpet shape can appear<br>
Trumpet announcing her female status<br>
Part of the fleshy, beautiful apparatus</p>
<p>
One woman trumpeting her perspective<br>
For all humans equal rights, objective<br>
To some it seemed like treason<br>
But she defended her moral reason<br>
Like a trumpet sound, clear and brave<br>
Her voice, to many hope gave </p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">Jesus<br>
<p style="margin-left:40px">Christ<br>
did not say worship men,<br>
you are a soul not a citizen,<br>
<p style="margin-left:40px">peace<br>
<p style="margin-left:40px">trade<br>
<p style="margin-left:40px">never<br>
<p style="margin-left:40px">invade,<br>
<p style="margin-left:40px">praise<br>	
<p style="margin-left:40px">LORD<br>
<p style="margin-left:40px">never<br>
<p style="margin-left:40px">priest<br>

When we say the name Jesus<br>
The cucks will tease us<br>
The woke will openly sneer<br>
But I see their sneaking fear<br>
